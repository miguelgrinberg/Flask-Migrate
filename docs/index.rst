Welcome to Flask-Migrate's documentation!
==========================================

**Flask-Migrate** is an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic. The database operations are provided as command line arguments for Flask-Script.

Installation
------------

Install Flask-Migrate with `pip`:

    pip install Flask-Migrate

Example
-------

This is an example application that handles database migrations through Flask-Migrate::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from flask.ext.script import Manager
    from flask.ext.migrate import Migrate, MigrateCommand

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'

    db = SQLAlchemy(app)
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)

    manager = Manager(app)
    manager.add_command('db', MigrateCommand)

    class User(db.Model):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        name = db.Column(db.String(128))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        manager.run()

With the above application you can create the database or enable migrations if the database already exists with the following command::

    $ python app.py db init
    
This will add a `migrations` folder to your application. The contents of this folder need to be added to version control along with your other source files. 

You can then generate an initial migration::

    $ python app.py db migrate
    
The migration script needs to be reviewed and edited, as Alembic currently does not detect every change you make to your models. In particular, Alembic is currently unable to detect indexes. Once finalized, the migration script also needs to be added to version control.

Then you can apply the migration to the database::

    $ python app.py db upgrade
    
Then each time the database models change repeat the ``migrate`` and ``upgrade`` commands.

To sync the database in another system just refresh the `migrations` folder from source control and run the ``upgrade`` command.

To see all the commands that are available run this command::

    $ python app.py db --help

Command Reference
-----------------

Flask-Migrate exposes two objects, ``Migrate`` and ``MigrateCommand``. The former is used to initialize the extension, while the latter is a ``Manager`` instance that needs to be registered with Flask-Script to expose the extension's command line options::

    from flask.ext.migrate import Migrate, MigrateCommand
    migrate = Migrate(app, db)
    manager.add_command('db', MigrateCommand)

The two arguments to ``Migrate`` are the application instance and the Flask-SQLAlchemy database instance. The ``Migrate`` constructor also takes additional keyword arguments, which are passed to Alembic's ``EnvironmentContext.configure()`` method.


The application will now have a ``db`` command line option with several sub-commands. If your launch script is called ``manage.py`` then the commands are:

- ``manage.py db --help``
    Shows a list of available commands.
    
- ``manage.py db init [--multidb]``
    Initializes migration support for the application. Turning on option ``--multidb`` will create multiple databases templates for alembic. This feature could be used with `Flask-SQLAlchemy Binds<https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/binds.html>`. Note that you do *NOT* need this option for other commands, e.g. migrate, upgrade, downgrade, etc. Two more steps are needed once you get the alembic template files:
    1. Add all database names to the filed ``databases`` in ``alembic.ini``. The ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` is by default already set as "primary" (you can customize it, but make sure it also gets updated in the ``env.py``), all keys in the ``SQLALCHEMY_BINDS`` should be append to ``database`` filed as a comma seperated string.
    2. Set ``target_metadata`` in ``env.py``, each database should have a ``db`` object, which, in turn, has all the table information in the ``metadata``. See more detail in the template comment.
    
- ``manage.py db revision [--message MESSAGE] [--autogenerate] [--sql] [--head HEAD] [--splice] [--branch-label BRANCH_LABEL] [--version-path VERSION_PATH] [--rev-id REV_ID]``
    Creates an empty revision script. The script needs to be edited manually with the upgrade and downgrade changes. See `Alembic's documentation <https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ for instructions on how to write migration scripts. An optional migration message can be included.
    
- ``manage.py db migrate [--message MESSAGE] [--sql] [--head HEAD] [--splice] [--branch-label BRANCH_LABEL] [--version-path VERSION_PATH] [--rev-id REV_ID]``
    Equivalent to ``revision --autogenerate``. The migration script is populated with changes detected automatically. The generated script should to be reviewed and edited as not all types of changes can be detected. This command does not make any changes to the database.
    
- ``manage.py db upgrade [--sql] [--tag TAG] <revision>``
    Upgrades the database. If ``revision`` isn't given then ``"head"`` is assumed.
    
- ``manage.py db downgrade [--sql] [--tag TAG] <revision>``
    Downgrades the database. If ``revision`` isn't given then ``-1`` is assumed.
    
- ``manage.py db stamp [--sql] [--tag TAG] <revision>``
    Sets the revision in the database to the one given as an argument, without performing any migrations.
    
- ``manage.py db current [--verbose]``
    Shows the current revision of the database.
    
- ``manage.py db history [--rev-range REV_RANGE] [--verbose]``
    Shows the list of migrations. If a range isn't given then the entire history is shown.

- ``manage.py db show <revision>``
    Show the revision denoted by the given symbol.

- ``manage.py db merge [--message MESSAGE] [--branch-label BRANCH_LABEL] [--rev-id REV_ID] <revisions>``
    Merge two revisions together. Creates a new migration file.

- ``manage.py db heads [--verbose] [--resolve-dependencies]``
    Show current available heads in the script directory.

- ``manage.py db branches [--verbose]``
    Show current branch points.

Notes:
 
- All commands also take a ``--directory DIRECTORY`` option that points to the directory containing the migration scripts. If this argument is omitted the directory used is `migrations`.
- The default directory can also be specified as a ``directory`` argument to the ``Migrate`` constructor.
- The ``--sql`` option present in several commands performs an 'offline' mode migration. Instead of executing the database commands the SQL statements that need to be executed are displayed.
- Documentation on these commands can be found in the `Alembic's command reference page <https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#commands>`_.

API Reference
-------------

The commands exposed by Flask-Migrate's interface to Flask-Script can also be accessed programmatically by importing the functions from module ``flask.ext.migrate``. The available functions are:

- ``init(directory='migrations', multidb=False)``
    Initializes migration support for the application.

- ``revision(directory='migrations', message=None, autogenerate=False, sql=False, head='head', splice=False, branch_label=None, version_path=None, rev_id=None)``
    Creates an empty revision script.

- ``migrate(directory='migrations', message=None, sql=False, head='head', splice=False, branch_label=None, version_path=None, rev_id=None)``
    Creates an automatic revision script.

- ``merge(directory='migrations', revisions='', message=None, branch_label=None, rev_id=None)``
    Merge two revisions together.  Creates a new migration file.

- ``upgrade(directory='migrations', revision='head', sql=False, tag=None)``
    Upgrades the database.

- ``downgrade(directory='migrations', revision='-1', sql=False, tag=None)``
    Downgrades the database.

- ``show(directory='migrations', revision='head')``
    Show the revision denoted by the given symbol.

- ``history(directory='migrations', rev_range=None, verbose=False)``
    Shows the list of migrations. If a range isn't given then the entire history is shown.

- ``heads(directory='migrations', verbose=False, resolve_dependencies=False)``
    Show current available heads in the script directory.

- ``branches(directory='migrations', verbose=False)``
    Show current branch points

- ``current(directory='migrations', verbose=False, head_only=False)``
    Shows the current revision of the database.
    
- ``stamp(directory='migrations', revision='head', sql=False, tag=None)``
    Sets the revision in the database to the one given as an argument, without performing any migrations.

Note: For greater scripting flexibility you can use the API exposed by Alembic directly.
